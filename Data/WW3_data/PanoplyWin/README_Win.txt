PANOPLY

  panoply \PAN-uh-plee\, noun: 1. A splendid or impressive array. [...]


INTRODUCTION

  Panoply is a Java application which enables the user to make plots of
  two-dimensional geo-gridded data from netCDF and HDF datasets, either 
  global longitude-latitude plots, pole-to-pole latitude-vertical plots,
  or time-latitude "keogram" plots. 2D arrays may be "sliced" from larger
  multidimensional arrays (aka, variables). A large selection of global
  map projections is available for lon-lat figures. Plot images may be
  saved to disk in PDF, PNG, PS or GIF format.

  Panoply requires that a Java 7 or 8 Runtime Environment be installed on your
  computer. If one is not already installed on your computer, you will need to
  download and install a JRE from http://www.java.com/


DOWNLOADING

  The current version of Panoply, along with other information about the
  application, may always be found at
  
  http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/


INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE PANOPLY FOR WINDOWS PACKAGE

  The Panoply package for Windows comes as a zipped archive. You _must_
  manually extract this archive. Some versions of Windows allow you to
  run programs from within a zipped archive without extraction. If you try
  this with Panoply, it won't work.

  The Panoply package for Windows should, after uncompression, include the
  following items:

  - Panoply.exe application.
  - Application code files in a folder called "jars".
  - This README file.
  
  To run Panoply, double-click on the Panoply.exe application.


JAR FILES

  The sub-directory called jars _must_ remain in the same directory as the
  panoply.sh application, and all the "jar" files it holds must remain in the
  jars sub-directory. These file contain the Panoply application code and
  (re)moving any of them will break Panoply.

  which provide solutions for a few basic installation problems.


COLOR TABLES AND CONTINENTS FILES

  Beginning with version 4, Panoply's "standard" selection of color tables
  and map overlays is built into the application. Additional color tables
  and map overlays may be opened for a single session or added to your
  favorites library for continued use. See the Panoply website for
  for such optional support files.
